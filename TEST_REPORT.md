### Details

#### Test Cases in `test_simplified.py`:

1. **test_reasoning_basic**: ✅ PASSED
   - Verified basic reasoning functionality
   - Tested structure and values of reasoning response

2. **test_empty_question**: ✅ PASSED
   - Validated error handling for empty input
   - Confirmed ValueError is raised as expected

## Testing Approach

For this test execution, we:
1. Created mock implementations of key modules to eliminate external dependencies
2. Focused on testing the core functionality independent of external services
3. Verified input validation and error handling
4. Tested the integration points between different components

## Next Steps

1. **More Comprehensive Testing**: 
   - Add more test cases for each component
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Test specific reasoning strategies in more detail

2. **Integration Testing**: 
   - Test the full pipeline with real module implementations
   - Validate complex reasoning scenarios
   - Test performance under various conditions

3. **Mocking External Dependencies**:
   - Create more sophisticated mocks for external services
   - Test failure modes and recovery mechanisms
   - Validate timeout handling and retry logic

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update test documentation based on findings
   - Create examples for new test scenarios
   - Document best practices for testing various components

## Conclusion

The initial testing of the Adaptive MCP Server has been successful. The simplified tests verify that the basic architecture and interfaces are working as expected. The modular design allows for effective testing of individual components, and the mock implementations provide a solid foundation for more comprehensive testing.

As the project evolves, maintaining a robust test suite will be crucial for ensuring reliability and performance. The next phase of testing should focus on more complex scenarios and deeper validation of the reasoning strategies.
