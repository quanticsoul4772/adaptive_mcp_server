# Adaptive MCP Server

## Overview

The Adaptive MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server is an advanced AI reasoning system designed to provide intelligent, multi-strategy solutions to complex questions. By combining multiple reasoning approaches, real-time research, and comprehensive validation, this system offers a sophisticated approach to information processing and answer generation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Strategy Reasoning**
  - Sequential Reasoning
  - Branching Reasoning
  - Abductive Reasoning
  - Lateral (Creative) Reasoning
  - Logical Reasoning

- **Advanced Research Integration**
  - Real-time information retrieval
  - Multiple search strategy support
  - Confidence-based result validation

- **Comprehensive Validation**
  - Semantic similarity checking
  - Factual accuracy assessment
  - Confidence scoring
  - Error detection

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment recommended

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/adaptive-mcp-server.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from reasoning import reasoning_orchestrator

async def main():
    # Ask a complex question
    result = await reasoning_orchestrator.reason(
        "What are the potential long-term impacts of artificial intelligence?"
    )
    
    print(result['answer'])
    print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
```

### Configuration
Create a `mcp_config.json` in the project root:
```json
{
    "research": {
        "api_key": "YOUR_EXA_SEARCH_API_KEY",
        "max_results": 5,
        "confidence_threshold": 0.6
    },
    "reasoning": {
        "strategies": [
            "sequential", 
            "branching", 
            "abductive"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Reasoning Strategies
```python
from reasoning import reasoning_orchestrator, ReasoningStrategy

# Customize strategy selection
custom_strategies = [
    ReasoningStrategy.LOGICAL, 
    ReasoningStrategy.LATERAL
]

# Use specific strategies
result = await reasoning_orchestrator.reason(
    "Design an innovative solution to urban transportation",
    strategies=custom_strategies
)
```

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific module tests
pytest tests/test_research.py
pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py
```

### Contributing
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: Leverage the modular design to extend reasoning capabilities
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Always check the `confidence` field in results
3. **Error Handling**: Implement try-except blocks when using the reasoning system
4. **API Key Management**: Use environment variables for sensitive configurations

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check your Exa Search API key
- Verify network connectivity
- Review logs for detailed error information
